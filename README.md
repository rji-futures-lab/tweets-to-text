# Tweets-To-Text

TweetsToText is a bot that lives on Twitter. It collects your tweets into plain text files. So you can take your brilliant observations somewhere else.

**This project is still in early development stages. It is not yet intended for public use.**

## How it works:

1. Follow [@TweetsToText](https://twitter.com/TweetsToText). It will follow you back.
2. Mention @TweetsToText before you start tweet-stormin'.
3. Mention @TweetsToText again in your final tweet.
4. Check your DMs. You should get a link from @TweetsToText where you can download your text file
5. Do whatever. It's a public link so you can share it with anyone.
